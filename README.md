# Portfolio Demo

This is a demo of a portfolio website that I created using Next.js and TypeScript. The website is fully responsive.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Run the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
5. Head over to `http://localhost:3000` to see the website

## Login

You can login to the website using the following credentials:

- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** password

## Testing

You can run the tests by running `npm run test` or `yarn test`

## Next.js Features

- I used SSR (Server Side Rendering) to improve the performance of the website. This allows me to pre-render the pages on the server and send the HTML to the client and improve the SEO
- I used SSG (Static Site Generation) to generate static pages for the website. This allows me to generate the pages at build time and serve them as static files. This improves the performance of the website and reduces the load on the server
- I used dynamic routing to create dynamic pages for the projects
- I used build-in CSS modules support, this allows me to write modular and scalable CSS code
- I used middleware to protect the admin routes

## Summary

I had a lot of fun building this project. Please keep in mind because of the short time frame, I didn't have the chance to implement all the features more in detail. I hope you like it!
